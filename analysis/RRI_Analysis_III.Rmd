# Effect of WM Load on Illusion 

Once you have classified your participants into two groups, those who fell for the illusion and those who did not, you can begin analyzing this systematically. 

Revisit Hypothesis 1 in your pre-registration and the analysis you set forth. 

## Aim
- Generate a contingency table of participants who fell/did not fall for the illusion, broken down by condition (`genre`,`working memory load`,`explicit information`)
- Perform a Chi-square to determine if more people fell for the illusion under certain treatments
- (Optionally) Perform a logistic regression to determine the likelihood of falling for the illusion, as a function of different variables
